# Computational Field Camp

> "It should be fine"

## Goals

Prototype a high-tech field school focused on adaptive data collection and on-site analysis. 
Awesome new multi-modal, open data set on a well-known outcrop with unresolved research questions.
The event is also a hackathon to figure out how to run the event. So we need to figure out things like...

* Logistics and cost.
* What can you get away with?
* How do you find and define problems to work on?
* How many people can you handle?
* What are the required skills?
* What kind of support is needed?
* What could it evolve into?

## Principles

* Everything is data, data is everything. 
* Multi-modal. High-dimensional, geolocated datasets.
* Just-in-time and fit-for-purpose (not just "all the data").
* Real, actual research problems. "Slaves not students" lol.

## Buzzwords

* Field school of the future
* Internet of things
* Machine learning
* Like IODP on land (well, ICDP already exists: http://www.icdp-online.org/home/; not as well known/funded as ocean drilling program, which has been around much, much longer )
* "Virtual jetpack"

## Gear

* Satellite imagery?
* aerial imaging, hyperspectral? 
* GigaPan?
* laser scanning (big scale)
* Laser scanning, hand specimens
* GR? Sonic? (+drone?)
* Calibrated colorimeter (+drone?)
* Porosimeter, permeameter
* XRD/XRF? (drone with dentist's drill)
* GPR?
* EM? (+drone?)
* Seismic?
* VR/AR
* Weird stuff: weather balloons, autonomous golf-carts

## Interested people

Self-declared interested:

* Brian 'BS' Burnham, Aberdeen
* Lisa Stright, Colorado State
* Brian Romans, VT
* John Leeman, Leeman Geophysical
* Brendon Hall, Enthought
* Joe Kington, Planet Labs
* Matt Hall, Agile
* Ben Outram, Shell (AR/VR and computer vision)
* Evan Bianco, Agile
* Nikita Bukhanov, `bnikita` on Swung
* Bane Sullivan, CSM

Ideas, not asked:

* John Howell, Aberdeen
* Gary Nichols, RPS Energy (ex-Nautilus, ex-RHBNC)
* Zoltan Sylvester — UT Austin
* John Thurmond, Equinor, Houston
* Steve Hubbard, U of C
* Chris Jackson, Imperial
* Clare Bond, Aberdeen
* Cari Johnson, U of Utah
* Brian Summa (http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~bsumma/)
* Valerio Pascusci (https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/pascucci.html)
* Zane Jobe, and his crew at CSM
* Callan Bentley, Carleton (GigaPan guru)

Perhaps 12–16 people total for this first effort? Up to 20 'should be fine'. 

## Logistics
* 3-ish (4?) entire days uninterrupted by travel
* A few hours' drive from Barcelona, Spain
* Window: April 2020
* Whatever we can get in 3–4 suburbans

## Money
We might need support for gear, travel and accommodation. Software will all be open source. Gear could be borrowed or purchased. If we do need dollars at some point... **TODO: Draft budget.**

## Location
Pick a locality that is “famous” among stratigraphers that has been worked to death over the past couple of decades. Five different interps based on field-work methods. Could elucidate some inconsistencies or debates.

Ideas:

* Ainsa Basin, turbidites or shallow marine.
* The Book Cliffs (10 places well known to AAPG pet. Stratigrapher community), e.g. Panther Tongue Mbr, Gentile Wash, Tuscher Canyon.

## Call 0: 3 August 2017
