# Hardware Underground hackathon

> A hackathon, but with hardware

This is just an idea. In a nutshell:

- Instrument design
- Pi HATs for geoscience or for teaching
- Instrument interfaces
- Internet of things
- Streaming data to ML models
- GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs and other interesting h/w platforms
- ML at the edge
- Anything relevant to [Computational Field Camp](Computational_Field_Camp.md)
- micro:bit etc for teaching about IoT etc.


## Probably involved or interested
