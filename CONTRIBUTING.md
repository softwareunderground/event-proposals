Software Underground organizes community tech events for scientists and engineers.

Historically, these events have fallen into the following categories:

* Hackathon (collaborative coding events, usually about 2 days)
* Unsession (an unstructured half-day-ish session at a conference)
* Unconference (an unstructured multi-day event)
* Meetup (an informal gathering, perhaps with lightning talks or tutorials)

We welcome suggestions or proposals. Please include the following:

* The name of the event
* Who you are
* What the purpose of the event ish
* Who might be interested, besides you
* Approximate budget and whether you have funding
* What kind of support you need

To get the event on the Software Underground radar:

* Put all that info in a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file and submit it to this repository.
* Let one of the maintainers team know that you're seeking feedback.
