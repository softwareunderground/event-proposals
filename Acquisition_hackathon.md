# Acquisition hackathon (acq hack, acq-athon)

> Competitive survey design

Can we get better at optimizing field acquisition parameters by hacking on them? In particular on geometry and effort.

Some thoughts:

* Basic idea: rent a field, bury a physical model (concrete blocks, etc), and challenge people to shoot a survey over it to get the best possible image.
* It would be good to see some forward modeling happening too. Perhaps cost modeling.
* We might not want to hack on instrument choice, for instance. We probably want a standard processing flow, if possible, to level the field there.
* Perhaps the idea pertains equally to non-seismic data?
* Valentin thinks it might be possible to use the test site in Lausanne.
